# BROCA

## Overview

BROCA is a minimal functional programming language that has various functionalities including computing basic arithmetic, declaring variables, using logical statements, functions, and even higher-order functions. This language was implemented to illustrate how languages are made into tokens, organized, and interpreted.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Variable Declaration**: Declare and use variables to store and manipulate data.
- **Logical Statements**: Utilize logical operators and statements to control the flow of your programs.
- **Loops**: Implement loops to perform repetitive tasks and iterate over data structures.
- **Functions**: Define and invoke functions to encapsulate and reuse code.
- **First-Class Functions**: Treat functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Use functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results, enabling more abstract and flexible programming patterns.
